I've uploaded a Python code repository in the directory $repo_path. Consider the following
GitHub issue description:

<problem_statement>
$problem_statement
</problem_statement>

Your task is to generate a **minimal and effective test** that clearly reproduces the issue described above.

You must create a **new test file** or add a test case to an existing test file in the repository, such that:
- The test fails with the original (buggy) version of the code.
- The test passes once the bug is fixed.
- The test clearly isolates the faulty behavior described in the problem statement.
- The test is **not flaky** and does not rely on side effects.

Please do **not** fix the issue in this step â€” only generate the test!

### Your Workflow:

1. First, explore the repository to understand where test files are stored and what the conventions are.
2. Then, determine the minimal condition required to reproduce the bug.
3. Create a new test file or modify an existing one with a failing test that confirms the issue.
4. You may use the `BashTool` to run `pytest` to confirm the test fails.
5. Save your test file in the correct location, typically `tests/` or equivalent.
6. Stop once the reproduction test is saved and confirmed to fail.
