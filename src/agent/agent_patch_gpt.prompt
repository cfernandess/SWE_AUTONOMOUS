### Task

Generate a **unified diff patch** that resolves the issue described above.

---

### Instructions

1. Only edit source code files (non-test `.py` files) inside `$repo_path`.
2. Do not modify any files under `tests/`, `docs/`, or `examples/`.
3. Use the following <repo_structure> as a guide to locate and edit the correct file(s):
4. Your patch must be valid Python and conform to repository style (e.g. PEP8).
5. Reproduce the error using `python <filename>` or relevant CLI commands.
6. Formulate a hypothesis about the root cause.
7. Edit the appropriate file(s) and rerun the script to verify the issue is resolved.
8. Think carefully about edge cases and side effects.
9. Discard patches that fail formatting, linting, or reproduction checks.
10. Output a single line of **JSONL**, with one key: `"diff"`.
    - The value must be a valid unified diff string beginning with `diff --git`
    - To patch multiple files, include all their diffs in the `"diff"` value as a single unified diff string.

### Tools available

* üñäÔ∏è `edit`: apply code changes to source files
* üß™ `bash`: run commands such as test scripts, linters, or reproduction scripts
* üîó `think`: use step-by-step reasoning before editing
* üîé `ruff_lint_tool`: you must validate your patch using Ruff before returning it

---

### Example

```json
{"diff": "diff --git a/pvlib/temperature.py b/pvlib/temperature.py\n--- a/pvlib/temperature.py\n+++ b/pvlib/temperature.py\n@@ def fuentes(...)\n-    timedelta_hours = ...\n+    timedelta_seconds = ...\n\ndiff --git a/pvlib/irradiance.py b/pvlib/irradiance.py\n--- a/pvlib/irradiance.py\n+++ b/pvlib/irradiance.py\n@@ def reindl(...):\n-    term3 = 1 + ...\n+    with np.errstate(...):\n+        hb_to_ghi = ..."}
````

### Final Reminder

* Run `ruff_lint_tool` on your patch before returning it.
* If Ruff returns `"PASSED"`, return the patch.
* If Ruff returns `"ERROR: <reason>"`, revise your patch and re-check.
* Only return the final JSONL object ‚Äî do not include markdown, explanations, or extra output.
